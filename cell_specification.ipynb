    "### 1. Background : Stem Cell Differentiation\n",
    "Every biological cell contains the same \"source code\" (DNA). However, a heart cell behaves differently from a neuron because they \"execute\" different parts of that code. In other words, genes are expressed at different levels. In order for cells to reach their fates ('final' type), they have to undergo a journey, the so called **cell differentiation** or **cell specification**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Biologists often use the **Waddington Landscape** analogy to describe the process of cell differentiation: imagine a ball rolling down a hilly terrain. At the top, the ball can go down many different valleys. By the bottom, the ball has journeyed through a specific path and is stuck in a specific state.\n",

    "### 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We quantify this execution by measuring the levels of **Gene Expression** throughout development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current project, the data follows **Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs)** over a period of 7 days (168 hours). \n",
    "At $T=0$, the cells are \"Pluripotent\"—we can think of them as uninitialized objects that have the potential to become almost any tissue type. As time progresses, they interprete gene expression levels as signals to **differentiate**. At the end of the experiement, we get two cell types: **E14** and **R1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Single-Cell Gene Expression** dataset at our disposal is the following. \n",
    "*   **Dimensions:** Each cell is a data object described by **96 features** (different marker genes, in addition to time and type of cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Type | Description |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Time** | `int` | The timestamp of the snapshot (0h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 120h, 168h). |\n",
    "| **Type** | `string` | The cell line background (**E14** or **R1**). These are two different \"classes\" of stem cells. |\n",
    "| **Genes** | `float` | **96 columns** (e.g., *Actb, Nanog, Sox2...*). These represent the normalized expression level of specific genes. |\n",
