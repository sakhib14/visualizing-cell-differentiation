# Project: Visualizing Cell Differentiation

![alt text](waddington2.png)

The current project consists in using gene expression data to visualize the differentiation trajectories of mouse embryonic stem cells. The gene expression dataset considered here was published by *Patrick S. Stumpf et al.* in  a paper titled *"Stem Cell Differentiation as a Non-Markov Stochastic Process," Cell Systems, 2017.* 
This is a guided project and all instructions can be found in the "cell_specification.ipynb" jupyter notebook. It is also expected that all written code reside in this file.

## Project Submission

To submit your project, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    Open your terminal in the folder where you want your project to live and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine (**make sure that you have git installed in your machine**):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/guijoe/visualizing-cell-differentiation.git
    ```

2.  **Complete the tasks**:
    Open the `cell_specification.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Follow the instructions within the notebook and write your code directly in the cells provided.

3.  **Rename and move the notebook**:
    Rename the `cell_specification.ipynb` notebook to `cell_specification_your-name.ipynb` (e.g. cell_specification_joel-dokmegang.ipynb). **Move** this file to the "submissions" folder.

4.  **Create a new branch**:
    Before committing your changes, create a new branch using your name (e.g., `your-name`):
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your-name>
    ```

5.  **Commit and push your changes**:
    Once you have finished the project, add and commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git add submissions/cell_specification_your-name.ipynb
    git commit -m "Completed cell differentiation project"
    ```
    Then, push your branch to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin <your-name>
    ```

6.  **Submit a Pull Request**:
    Go to the repository page on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch. Click on it, review your changes, and submit the Pull Request for review.
